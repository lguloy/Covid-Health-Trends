# Covid-Health-Trends

Project Proposal Statement
Our project is to examine the Covid-19 cases in the United States and analyze them in the global, state and county. We would use this data to determine relationships to see if covid policies did mitigate the spread of covid or not. We will look at the case counts per day and make comparisons between locations with different mitigation policies.

A detailed explanation of the methodology and data analysis are located in the pdf folder. This data analysis was done using Python and Pandas to clean and visualize the data in a presentable manner
